[{"content":"IPtables DDoS Protection: The Best Rules to Mitigate DDoS Attacks\niptables DDoS Protection\nThere are different ways of building your own anti-DDoS rules for iptables. We will be discussing the most effective iptables DDoS protection methods in this comprehensive tutorial. This guide will teach you how to:\nSelect the best iptables table and chain to stop DDoS attacks\rTweak your kernel settings to mitigate the effects of DDoS attacks\rUse iptables to block most TCP-based DDoS attacks\rUse iptables SYNPROXY to block SYN floods\rPlease note that this article is written for professionals who deal with Linux servers on a daily basis. If you just want to protect your online application from DDoS attacks, you can use our remote protection, a VPS with DDoS protection or a DDoS protected bare metal server.\nWhile one can do a lot with iptables to block DDoS attacks, there isn\u0026rsquo;t a way around actual hardware firewalls (we recently reviewed RioRey DDoS mitigation hardware) to detect and stop large DDoS floods. However, it isn\u0026rsquo;t impossible to filter most bad traffic at line rate using iptables.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll only cover protection from TCP-based attacks. Most UDP-based attacks are amplified reflection attacks that will exhaust the network interface card of any common server. The only mitigation approach that makes sense against these types of attacks is to block them at the edge or core network or even at the carrier already. If they are able to reach your server, there isn\u0026rsquo;t much you can do against those multi-Gbit/s attacks except to move to a DDoS protected network.\nanti-DDoS iptables What Is IPtables?\nnetfilter iptables (soon to be replaced by nftables) is a user-space command line utility to configure kernel packet filtering rules developed by netfilter. It\u0026rsquo;s the default firewall management utility on Linux systems - everyone working with Linux systems should be familiar with it or have at least heard of it.\niptables can be used to filter certain packets, block source or destination ports and IP addresses, forward packets via NAT and a lot of other things. Most commonly it\u0026rsquo;s used to block destination ports and source IP addresses. Why Your IPtables Anti-DDoS Rules Suck\nTo understand why your current iptables rules to prevent DDoS attacks suck, we first have to dig into how iptables works.\niptables is a command line tool used to set up and control the tables of IP packet filter rules. There are different tables for different purposes. IPtables Tables\nFilter: The filter table is the default and most commonly used table that rules go to if you don\u0026rsquo;t use the -t (\u0026ndash;table) option.\nNat: This table is used for Network Address Translation (NAT). If a packet creates a new connection, the nat table gets checked for rules.\nMangle: The mangle table is used to modify or mark packets and their header information.\nRaw: This table\u0026rsquo;s purpose is mainly to exclude certain packets from connection tracking using the NOTRACK target.\nAs you can see there are four different tables on an average Linux system that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have non-standard kernel modules loaded. Each of these tables supports a different set of iptables chains. IPtables Chains PREROUTING: raw, nat, mangle\nApplies to packets that enter the network interface card (NIC)\rINPUT: filter, mangle\nApplies to packets destined to a local socket\rFORWARD: filter, mangle\nApplies to packets that are being routed through the server\rOUTPUT: raw, filter, nat, mangle\nApplies to packets that the server sends (locally generated)\rPOSTROUTING: nat, mangle\nApplies to packets that leave the server\rDepending on what kind of packets you want to block or modify, you select a certain iptables table and a chain that the selected table supports.\nOf course, we\u0026rsquo;re still missing an explanation of iptables targets (ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT, etc.), but we\u0026rsquo;re assuming that if you\u0026rsquo;re reading this article, you already know how to deal with iptables.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to explain why your iptables rules suck to stop DDoS and not teach you how to use iptables. Let\u0026rsquo;s get back to that.\nIf you want to block a DDoS attack with iptables, performance of the iptables rules is extremely important. Most TCP-based DDoS attack types use a high packet rate, meaning the sheer number of packets per second is what causes the server to go down. That\u0026rsquo;s why you want to make sure that you can process and block as many packets per second as possible.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll find that most if not all guides on how to block DDoS attacks using iptables use the filter table and the INPUT chain for anti-DDoS rules. The issue with this approach is that the INPUT chain is only processed after the PREROUTING and FORWARD chains and therefore only applies if the packet doesn\u0026rsquo;t match any of these two chains.\nThis causes a delay in the filtering of the packet which consumes resources. In conclusion, to make our rules as effective as possible, we need to move our anti-DDoS rules as far up the chains as possible. The first chain that can apply to a packet is the PREROUTING chain, so ideally we\u0026rsquo;ll want to filter the bad packets in this chain already.\nHowever, the filter table doesn\u0026rsquo;t support the PREROUTING chain. To get around this problem, we can simply use the mangle table instead of the filter table for our anti-DDoS iptables rules. It supports most if not all rules that the filter table supports while also supporting all iptables chains.\nSo you want to know why your iptables DDoS protection rules suck? It\u0026rsquo;s because you use the filter table and the INPUT chain to block the bad packets! The best solution to dramatically increase the performance of your iptables rules and therefore the amount of (TCP) DDoS attack traffic they can filter is to use the mangle table and the PREROUTING chain! The Best Linux Kernel Settings to Mitigate DDoS\nAnother common mistake is that people don\u0026rsquo;t use optimized kernel settings to better mitigate the effects of DDoS attacks. Note that this guide focuses on CentOS 7 as the operating system of choice. CentOS 7 includes a recent version of iptables and support of the new SYNPROXY target.\nWe won\u0026rsquo;t cover every single kernel setting that you need to adjust in order to better mitigate DDoS with iptables. Instead, we provide a set of CentOS 7 kernel settings that we would use. Just put the below in your /etc/sysctl.conf file and apply the settings with sysctl -p. Anti-DDoS Kernel Settings (sysctl.conf)\nkernel.printk = 4 4 1 7\rkernel.panic = 10\rkernel.sysrq = 0\rkernel.shmmax = 4294967296\rkernel.shmall = 4194304\rkernel.core_uses_pid = 1\rkernel.msgmnb = 65536\rkernel.msgmax = 65536\rvm.swappiness = 20\rvm.dirty_ratio = 80\rvm.dirty_background_ratio = 5\rfs.file-max = 2097152\rnet.core.netdev_max_backlog = 262144\rnet.core.rmem_default = 31457280\rnet.core.rmem_max = 67108864\rnet.core.wmem_default = 31457280\rnet.core.wmem_max = 67108864\rnet.core.somaxconn = 65535\rnet.core.optmem_max = 25165824\rnet.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh1 = 4096\rnet.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2 = 8192\rnet.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3 = 16384\rnet.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_interval = 5\rnet.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_stale_time = 120\rnet.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max = 10000000\rnet.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_loose = 0\rnet.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_established = 1800\rnet.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_close = 10\rnet.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_close_wait = 10\rnet.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_fin_wait = 20\rnet.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_last_ack = 20\rnet.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_syn_recv = 20\rnet.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_syn_sent = 20\rnet.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_time_wait = 10\rnet.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle = 0\rnet.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65000\rnet.ipv4.ip_no_pmtu_disc = 1\rnet.ipv4.route.flush = 1\rnet.ipv4.route.max_size = 8048576\rnet.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1\rnet.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1\rnet.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = htcp\rnet.ipv4.tcp_mem = 65536 131072 262144\rnet.ipv4.udp_mem = 65536 131072 262144\rnet.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 33554432\rnet.ipv4.udp_rmem_min = 16384\rnet.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 87380 33554432\rnet.ipv4.udp_wmem_min = 16384\rnet.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets = 1440000\rnet.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 0\rnet.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1\rnet.ipv4.tcp_max_orphans = 400000\rnet.ipv4.tcp_window_scaling = 1\rnet.ipv4.tcp_rfc1337 = 1\rnet.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1\rnet.ipv4.tcp_synack_retries = 1\rnet.ipv4.tcp_syn_retries = 2\rnet.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 16384\rnet.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 1\rnet.ipv4.tcp_sack = 1\rnet.ipv4.tcp_fack = 1\rnet.ipv4.tcp_ecn = 2\rnet.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 10\rnet.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 600\rnet.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl = 60\rnet.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes = 10\rnet.ipv4.tcp_no_metrics_save = 1\rnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 0\rnet.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0\rnet.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0\rnet.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0\rnet.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1 These sysctl.conf settings help to maximize the performance of your server under DDoS as well as the effectiveness of the iptables rules that we\u0026rsquo;re going to provide in this guide. The Actual IPtables Anti-DDoS Rules\nConsidering you now know that you need to use the mangle table and the PREROUTING chain as well as optimized kernel settings to mitigate the effects of DDoS attacks, we\u0026rsquo;ll now move on to a couple of example rules to mitigate most TCP DDoS attacks.\nDDoS attacks are complex. There are many different types of DDoS and it\u0026rsquo;s close to impossible to maintain signature-based rules against all of them. But luckily there is something called connection tracking (nf_conntrack kernel module), which can help us to mitigate almost any TCP-based DDoS attack that doesn\u0026rsquo;t use SYN packets that seem legitimate. This includes all types of ACK and SYN-ACK DDoS attacks as well as DDoS attacks that use bogus TCP flags.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with just five simple iptables rules that will already drop many TCP-based DDoS attacks. Block Invalid Packets\niptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP This rule blocks all packets that are not a SYN packet and don\u0026rsquo;t belong to an established TCP connection. Block New Packets That Are Not SYN\niptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp ! --syn -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j DROP This blocks all packets that are new (don\u0026rsquo;t belong to an established connection) and don\u0026rsquo;t use the SYN flag. This rule is similar to the \u0026ldquo;Block Invalid Packets\u0026rdquo; one, but we found that it catches some packets that the other one doesn\u0026rsquo;t. Block Uncommon MSS Values\niptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -m tcpmss ! --mss 536:65535 -j DROP The above iptables rule blocks new packets (only SYN packets can be new packets as per the two previous rules) that use a TCP MSS value that is not common. This helps to block dumb SYN floods. Block Packets With Bogus TCP Flags\niptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG NONE -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN FIN,SYN -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN,RST -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,FIN SYN,FIN -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags FIN,RST FIN,RST -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags FIN,ACK FIN -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ACK,URG URG -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ACK,FIN FIN -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ACK,PSH PSH -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL ALL -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL NONE -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL FIN,PSH,URG -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL SYN,FIN,PSH,URG -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL SYN,RST,ACK,FIN,URG -j DROP The above ruleset blocks packets that use bogus TCP flags, ie. TCP flags that legitimate packets wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use. Block Packets From Private Subnets (Spoofing)\niptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 224.0.0.0/3 -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 169.254.0.0/16 -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 172.16.0.0/12 -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 192.0.2.0/24 -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/16 -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 0.0.0.0/8 -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 240.0.0.0/5 -j DROP\riptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 127.0.0.0/8 ! -i lo -j DROP These rules block spoofed packets originating from private (local) subnets. On your public network interface you usually don\u0026rsquo;t want to receive packets from private source IPs. These rules assume that your loopback interface uses the 127.0.0.0/8 IP space.\nThese five sets of rules alone already block many TCP-based DDoS attacks at very high packet rates. With the kernel settings and rules mentioned above, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to filter ACK and SYN-ACK attacks at line rate. Additional Rules\niptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p icmp -j DROP This drops all ICMP packets. ICMP is only used to ping a host to find out if it\u0026rsquo;s still alive. Because it\u0026rsquo;s usually not needed and only represents another vulnerability that attackers can exploit, we block all ICMP packets to mitigate Ping of Death (ping flood), ICMP flood and ICMP fragmentation flood.\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m connlimit --connlimit-above 80 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset This iptables rule helps against connection attacks. It rejects connections from hosts that have more than 80 established connections. If you face any issues you should raise the limit as this could cause troubles with legitimate clients that establish a large number of TCP connections.\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m conntrack \u0026ndash;ctstate NEW -m limit \u0026ndash;limit 60/s \u0026ndash;limit-burst 20 -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m conntrack \u0026ndash;ctstate NEW -j DROP\nLimits the new TCP connections that a client can establish per second. This can be useful against connection attacks, but not so much against SYN floods because the usually use an endless amount of different spoofed source IPs.\niptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -f -j DROP This rule blocks fragmented packets. Normally you don\u0026rsquo;t need those and blocking fragments will mitigate UDP fragmentation flood. But most of the time UDP fragmentation floods use a high amount of bandwidth that is likely to exhaust the capacity of your network card, which makes this rule optional and probably not the most useful one.\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -m limit --limit 2/s --limit-burst 2 -j ACCEPT\riptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP This limits incoming TCP RST packets to mitigate TCP RST floods. Effectiveness of this rule is questionable. Mitigating SYN Floods With SYNPROXY\nSYNPROXY is a new target of iptables that has been added in Linux kernel version 3.12 and iptables 1.4.21. CentOS 7 backported the feature and it\u0026rsquo;s available in its 3.10 default kernel.\nThe purpose of SYNPROXY is to check whether the host that sent the SYN packet actually establishes a full TCP connection or just does nothing after it sent the SYN packet. If it does nothing, it discards the packet with minimal performance impact.\nWhile the iptables rules that we provided above already block most TCP-based attacks, the attack type that can still slip through them if sophisticated enough is a SYN flood. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the performance of the rules will always be better if we find a certain pattern or signature to block, such as packet length (-m length), TOS (-m tos), TTL (-m ttl) or strings and hex values (-m string and -m u32 for the more advanced users). But in some rare cases that\u0026rsquo;s not possible or at least not easy to achieve. So in these cases, you can make use of SYNPROXY.\nHere are iptables SYNPROXY rules that help mitigate SYN floods that bypass our other rules:\niptables -t raw -D PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --syn -j CT --notrack\riptables -D INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID,UNTRACKED -j SYNPROXY --sack-perm --timestamp --wscale 7 --mss 1460\riptables -D INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP These rules apply to all ports. If you want to use SYNPROXY only on certain TCP ports that are active (recommended - also you should block all TCP ports that are not in use using the mangle table and PREROUTING chain), you can just add \u0026ndash;dport 80 to each of the rules if you want to use SYNPROXY on port 80 only.\nTo verify that SYNPROXY is working, you can do watch -n1 cat /proc/net/stat/synproxy. If the values change when you establish a new TCP connection to the port you use SYNPROXY on, it works. The Complete IPtables Anti-DDoS Rules\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t want to copy \u0026amp; paste each single rule we discussed in this article, you can use the below ruleset for basic DDoS protection of your Linux server.\nDrop invalid packets /sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP Drop TCP packets that are new and are not SYN /sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp ! --syn -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j DROP Drop SYN packets with suspicious MSS value /sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -m tcpmss ! --mss 536:65535 -j DROP Block packets with bogus TCP flags /sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,PSH,ACK,URG NONE -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags FIN,SYN FIN,SYN -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN,RST -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,FIN SYN,FIN -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags FIN,RST FIN,RST -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags FIN,ACK FIN -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ACK,URG URG -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ACK,FIN FIN -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ACK,PSH PSH -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL ALL -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL NONE -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL FIN,PSH,URG -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL SYN,FIN,PSH,URG -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL SYN,RST,ACK,FIN,URG -j DROP Block spoofed packets /sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 224.0.0.0/3 -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 169.254.0.0/16 -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 172.16.0.0/12 -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 192.0.2.0/24 -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/16 -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 0.0.0.0/8 -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 240.0.0.0/5 -j DROP\r/sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -s 127.0.0.0/8 ! -i lo -j DROP Drop ICMP (you usually don\u0026rsquo;t need this protocol) /sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p icmp -j DROP Drop fragments in all chains /sbin/iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -f -j DROP Limit connections per source IP /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m connlimit --connlimit-above 111 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset Limit RST packets /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -m limit --limit 2/s --limit-burst 2 -j ACCEPT\r/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags RST RST -j DROP Limit new TCP connections per second per source IP /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -m limit --limit 60/s --limit-burst 20 -j ACCEPT\r/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j DROP Use SYNPROXY on all ports (disables connection limiting rule) #/sbin/iptables -t raw -D PREROUTING -p tcp -m tcp --syn -j CT --notrack\r#/sbin/iptables -D INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID,UNTRACKED -j SYNPROXY --sack-perm --timestamp --wscale 7 --mss 1460\r#/sbin/iptables -D INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP Bonus Rules\nHere are some more iptables rules that are useful to increase the overall security of a Linux server:\nSSH brute-force protection /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -m recent --set\r/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 10 -j DROP Protection against port scanning /sbin/iptables -N port-scanning\r/sbin/iptables -A port-scanning -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,ACK,FIN,RST RST -m limit --limit 1/s --limit-burst 2 -j RETURN\r/sbin/iptables -A port-scanning -j DROP Conclusion This tutorial demonstrates some of the most powerful and effective methods to stop DDoS attacks using iptables.

If used correctly, iptables is an extremely powerful tool that\u0026rsquo;s able to block different types of DDoS attacks at line-rate of 1GigE NICs and close to line-rate of 10GigE NICs.

This configuration file aims to provide better security for Linux systems and improves system performance whenever possible. For example, below are some of the features this configuration file provides.\nPrevents kernel pointers from being read Disables Ptrace for all programs Disallows core dumping by SUID/GUID programs Disables IPv4/IPv6 routing Enables BBR TCP congestion control Enables SYN cookies to mitigate SYN flooding attacks Enables IP reverse path filtering for source validation \u0026hellip; Please review the configuration file carefully before applying it. You are responsible for actions done to your system. If you need some guidance understanding what each of the settings is for, sysctl-explorer might come in handy. You may also consult Linux\u0026rsquo;s kernel documentation.\nAssumptions This configuration file is written with a few assumptions about your OS. You can still use this configuration as a template if your OS does not match these assumptions (e.g., set net.ipv4.ip_forward to 1 on a router). Making these assumptions helps us to develop a configuration file with the most number of optimizations enabled for common systems.\nSecurity is valued over performance and convenience The OS does not act as a router The OS is running on a 64-bit system The OS is on a network that is relatively stable (e.g., wired vs. LTE) No debugging features are required (e.g., no need for GDB/kdump) ICMP echo messages are not regarded as harmful Configuration Deployment Linux kernel configuration files are stored in the directory /etc/sysctl.d. Configurations in all files having a suffix of .conf will read by the procps (a.k.a. systemd-sysctl) service. Additionally, the procps service also loads configurations from the following directories.\n/run/sysctl.d /usr/local/lib/sysctl.d /usr/lib/sysctl.d /lib/sysctl.d Files are sorted and read by their file names in lexicographic order. Variables read later will overwrite variables read earlier. For example, configurations in 20-something.conf will be read before 99-sysctl.conf. If a variable exists in both files, values read from 20-something.conf will be overwritten by values read from 99-sysctl.conf.\n# in 20-something.conf\rnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 0\r# in 99-sysctl.conf\rnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 1\r# net.ipv4.ip_forward will be 1 Method 1: Deploy Definitively By default, on most Linux distributions, the /etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf file is a link to the /etc/sysctl.conf file. Therefore, you may write the variables into the /etc/sysctl.conf. However, since configuration files with a file name that starts with an alphabetical character sort later in the list than 99-sysctl.conf, the changes you make in the /etc/sysctl.conf might not be the final value loaded into the kernel. To make sure that your changes are loaded into the kernel, you would have to make sure that your configuration file\u0026rsquo;s name is lexicographically the last file in /etc/sysctl.d. The filename z-k4yt3x.conf will be used as an example in the code snippet below.\nThis deployment method is suitable for systems that do not expect to have their sysctl configurations updated from this repository anymore. Otherwise, the configuration file\u0026rsquo;s content has to be updated every time a new update form this repository is installed.\n# download the configuration file from GitHub using curl curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k4yt3x/sysctl/master/sysctl.conf -o ~/sysctl.conf # you may also download with wget or other methods if curl is not available wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k4yt3x/sysctl/master/sysctl.conf -O ~/sysctl.conf # move the configuration file into the sysctl configuration directory sudo mv ~/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/z-k4yt3x.conf # make sure the file has correct ownership and permissions sudo chown root:root /etc/sysctl.d/z-k4yt3x.conf sudo chmod 644 /etc/sysctl.d/z-k4yt3x.conf Method 2: Deploy as Template Alternatively, you can use this configuration file as a template. If you name the configuration file something akin to /etc/sysctl.d/98-k4yt3x.conf, you may overwrite values in this configuration file by giving them a new definition the /etc/sysctl.conf file.\nThe advantage of doing this is that you would not have to change this template file\u0026rsquo;s content every time it is updated in this repository. You can drop the template file in and make any modifications in /etc/sysctl.conf.\nThis method\u0026rsquo;s disadvantage is that values from this template might be overwritten by values in other configurations unknowingly. For example, a uhd-usrp2.conf exists on my system, and overwrites the value of net.core.rmem_max and net.core.wmem_max set in previous configuration files. Packages managers can install new configurations as you install a new package or update your system. Therefore, you will have to be careful that other files do not overwrite your variables.\n# download the configuration file from GitHub using curl curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k4yt3x/sysctl/master/sysctl.conf -o ~/sysctl.conf # you may also download with wget or other methods if curl is not available wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k4yt3x/sysctl/master/sysctl.conf -O ~/sysctl.conf # move the configuration file into the sysctl configuration directory sudo mv ~/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/98-k4yt3x.conf # make sure the file has correct ownership and permissions sudo chown root:root /etc/sysctl.d/98-k4yt3x.conf sudo chmod 644 /etc/sysctl.d/98-k4yt3x.conf Method 3: Custom Order (Personal Recommendation) To ensure that the configuration files are read in an order you prefer, you may also rename the files to your preference. For example, you can install this template to /etc/sysctl.d/y-k4yt3x.conf, then make a symbolic link from /etc/sysctl.d/z-sysctl.conf to /etc/sysctl.conf. This ensures that the two files are more likely to be read the last.\n# download the configuration file from GitHub using curl curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k4yt3x/sysctl/master/sysctl.conf -o ~/sysctl.conf # you may also download with wget or other methods if curl is not available wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k4yt3x/sysctl/master/sysctl.conf -O ~/sysctl.conf # move the configuration file into the sysctl configuration directory sudo mv ~/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/y-k4yt3x.conf # make sure the file has correct ownership and permissions sudo chown root:root /etc/sysctl.d/y-k4yt3x.conf sudo chmod 644 /etc/sysctl.d/y-k4yt3x.conf # point z-sysctl.conf to /etc/sysctl.conf sudo ln -s /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/z-sysctl.conf Loading and Verifying the Changes For the changes to be effective, you will have to either reboot your machine or reload the configurations using one of the following commands.\n# instruct sysctl to load settings from the configuration file into the live kernel # this command allows you to see the variables as they are being loaded sudo sysctl --system # alternatively, you can restart the systemd-sysctl service on a system that uses systemd sudo systemctl restart systemd-sysctl # procps is an alias of systemd-sysctl # restarting either one of procps and systemd-sysctl would work sudo systemctl restart procps Afterwards, you may verify your changes by dumping all kernel variables. Replace your.config in the following command with the name of the variable you would like to check.\nsudo sysctl -a | grep \u0026#34;your.config\u0026#34; For example, the following command prints the value of kernel.kptr_restrict.\n$ sudo sysctl -a | grep \u0026#34;kernel.kptr_restrict\u0026#34; kernel.kptr_restrict = 2 Short URL for Downloading sysctl.conf For convenience, I have pointed the URL https://k4t.io/sysctl to the sysctl.conf file. You may therefore download the sysctl.conf file with the following command. However, be sure to check the file\u0026rsquo;s integrity after downloading it if you choose to download using this method.\ncurl -L k4t.io/sysctl -o sysctl.conf Backup sysctl.conf ","permalink":"https://shenlong616.github.io/posts/github/hardened-sysctl-configuration-by-k4yt3x/","summary":"This repository hosts my hardened version of sysctl.conf.

The other parameters must be given when the partial function is called:\nfrom functools import partial def func(x, y, z): return x + 2*y + 3*z my_func = partial(func, 2, 3) # assign (preset) 2 to x, 3 to y my_func(3) # equivalent to func(2, 3, 3) # prints 17 my_func(4) # equivalent to func(2, 3, 4) # prints 20 Fastest way to format multiple strings Going from fastest to slowest, they are:\nf\u0026#39;{s} {t}\u0026#39; # fastest s + \u0026#39; \u0026#39; + t \u0026#39; \u0026#39;.join((s, t)) \u0026#39;%s %s\u0026#39; % (s, t) \u0026#39;{} {}\u0026#39;.format(s, t) Template(\u0026#39;$s $t\u0026#39;).substitute(s=s, t=t) # slowest Note: f-strings were added in Python 3.6.\nIterating until a sentinel value This method has 2 forms:\niter(iterable) - this form simply returns an iterator from the iterable. You can call next() on the iterator and iterate through the iterable. langs = [\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;python\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;java\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c++\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;kotlin\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39;] ir = iter(langs) print(next(ir)) # prints c print(next(ir)) # prints python iter(callable, sentinel) - this form executes the function callable until it returns sentinel value. def func(langs = []): langs.append(\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;) return len(langs) ir = iter(func, 5) next(ir) # prints 1 next(ir) # prints 2 next(ir) # prints 3 next(ir) # prints 4 next(ir) # raise StopIteration Read 80 characters from file f into line and append to text until f.read() returns '':\ntext = list() for line in iter(partial(f.read, 80), \u0026#39;\u0026#39;): text.append(line) For else in Python Search a certain value in an iterable and do something if it is not there:\nlangs = [\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;python\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;java\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c++\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;kotlin\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39;] for lang in langs: if lang == \u0026#39;scala\u0026#39;: print(\u0026#39;We found Scala!\u0026#39;) break else: print(\u0026#39;Scala is not in the list...\u0026#39;) Note: Careful if you ever come back to this kind of code. Don\u0026rsquo;t indent the else statement by accident!!!\nLooping over dictionary keys d = { \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;java\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;baz\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39; } # cannot mutate dictionary here for k in d: print(k) # free to mutate the keys and values for k in list(d.keys()): if k == \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;: del d[k] Note: d.keys() used to make a list copy of the keys, so there was no problem iterating and mutating the original dictionary at the same time. In modern Python3, d.keys() returns an iterable and can no longer be used to iterate and mutate a dictionary at the same time. To go around this, just wrap the method into a list as in the example.\nNote 2: There is an \u0026lsquo;alternative\u0026rsquo; to this, but it has worse performance and memory usage:\nd = { \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;java\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;baz\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39; } # Don\u0026#39;t do this, performance is bad as it copies every element in a dictionary and can be really bad for really big dictionaries s = {k: v for k, v in d.items() if k != \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;} Looping over dictionary keys and values d = { \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;java\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;baz\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39; } for k, v in d.items(): print(f\u0026#39;{k} --\u0026gt; {v}\u0026#39;) The items() method returns and iterator, so it uses the same amount of memory no matter how big the dictionary is.\nNote: In python2, the items() method used to return a list of tuples, and the iteritems() used to do what items() does now in python3.\nConstruct a dictionary from 2 iterables Use the zip() method to pack 2 iterables into a zip object, then use the dict() method to make that into a dictionary.\nlangs = [\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;python\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;java\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c++\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;kotlin\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39;] colors = [\u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;green\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;] d = dict(zip(langs, colors)) print(d) # prints {\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;python\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;green\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;java\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;} s = dict(enumerate(colors)) print(s) # prints {1: \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, 2: \u0026#39;green\u0026#39;, 3: \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;} Populating a dictionary with default data (Counting with dictionary) Use the defaultdict() method imported from collections. When a key is not in the dictionary, it creates a new key that has the default value.\nfrom collections import defaultdict colors = [\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;green\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;green\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;] d = defaultdict(int) for color in colors: d[color] += 1 print(dict(d)) # prints {\u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;: 1, \u0026#39;green\u0026#39;: 2, \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;: 3} Note: This is a faster approach than setdefault() on most cases and faster than get() in all cases. Also, defaultdict() seems to work faster on native types like int or string and slower on dict or list. That being said, there are times when you cannot use defaultdict() and have to use either setdefault() or get(), for example when the default value of a certain key depends on the key itself, so defaultdict() cannot be used from the beginning to have a default value for every new key.\ncolors = [\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;green\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;green\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;] d = {} for color in colors: d[color] = d.setdefault(color, 2 if color == \u0026#39;red\u0026#39; else 0) + 1 print(d) # prints {\u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;: 1, \u0026#39;green\u0026#39;: 2, \u0026#39;red\u0026#39;: 5} Note 2: A case where get() accomplishes nicely what setdefault() and defaultdict() would do in a more complicated manner is when you have to return a default value from a dictionary if the key is not in it.\nd = { 1: \u0026#39;Alice\u0026#39;, 2: \u0026#39;Bob\u0026#39;, 3: \u0026#39;Carla\u0026#39; } def hello(id): return f\u0026#39;Hi, {d.get(id, \u0026#34;random person\u0026#34;)}\u0026#39; print(hello(1)) # prints Hi, Alice print(hello(4)) # prints Hi, random person Creating a list with n elements Say you want to create a list with 100 elements of 0. You can just do:\nlst = [0] * 100 print(lst) Ternary operator in Python This:\n#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt; int main() { int x; int y = 1; x = (y == 1 ? 1 : 0); printf(\u0026#34;%d\u0026#34;, x); return 0; } can be written like this in python:\ny = 1 x = (1 if y == 1 else 0) print(x) Grouping data with dictionaries Say you want to group the items in a list based on some comparison function, for example len():\nfrom collections import defaultdict names = [\u0026#39;julia\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mark\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;thomas\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rachel\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;alex\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;maria\u0026#39;] d = defaultdict(list) for name in names: key = len(name) d[key].append(name) print(dict(d)) # prints {5: [\u0026#39;julia\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;maria\u0026#39;], 4: [\u0026#39;mark\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;alex\u0026#39;], 6: [\u0026#39;thomas\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rachel\u0026#39;]} All you have to do to group based on some other function is change the key to something else.\nUnpacking sequences p = \u0026#39;alex\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, 20, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39; # same as p = (\u0026#39;alex\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, 20, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;) name, color, age, lang = p print(p) # prints a tuple - (\u0026#39;alex\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, 20, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;) print(name, color, age, lang) # prints alex blue 20 c Note: In the same manner, swapping 2 variables in python might be the most elegant way out of all the languages:\nx, y = 1, 2 # swap x and y x, y = y, x print(x, y) # prints 2 1 Concatenating strings Use the join() method to concatenate strings from an iterable.\nlangs = [\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;python\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;java\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c++\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;kotlin\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39;] # join the strings from langs, having \u0026#39;, \u0026#39; as separator text = \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;.join(langs) print(text) # prints c, python, java, c++, kotlin, rust Atomicity of builtin data types Most (!not all) of the builtin data types methods are implemented using C function calls, so that makes it atomic.\nFor a better explanaton check here.\nAlso, dictionaries\u0026rsquo; popitem() is atomic, while pop() may not, based on the key type (if the key is not a builtin data type, Python has to call that object\u0026rsquo;s __hash__() implementation), so better use popitem() where atomicity is needed.\nd = { \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;java\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;baz\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39; } while d: key, value = d.popitem() print(f\u0026#39;{key} --\u0026gt; {value}\u0026#39;) # prints # foo --\u0026gt; c # bar --\u0026gt; java # baz --\u0026gt; rust # d is empty at the end Note: If unsure, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to use mutexes!\nLinking and overriding dictionaries with defaults When you have a dictionary that has some default values and you want to override it with another dictionary, use ChainMap(). ChainMap() has the advantage that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t copy anything, it just \u0026ldquo;links\u0026rdquo; the dictionaries, using the initial memory (this also means that any change in the initial dictionary will be reflected in the ChainMap() as well).\nfrom collections import ChainMap defaults = { \u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;java\u0026#39; } overwritten = { \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;barn\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;c++\u0026#39; } d = ChainMap(overwritten, defaults) print(dict(d)) # prints {\u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;barn\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;c++\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;} Note: Don\u0026rsquo;t use copy() and then update(), it is really bad performance-wise and can be replaced in 99% of the cases by a ChainMap().\nd1 = { \u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;java\u0026#39; } d2 = { \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;barn\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;c++\u0026#39; } # Don\u0026#39;t do this!! d = d1.copy() d.update(d2) Note 2: For a better example when this is useful, see this.\nOrdered dictionary A dictionary is not guaranteed to preserve the order of insertion. It actually optimizes keys for faster lookup. However there is one way to have a dictionary preserve insertion order, using OrderedDict() from collections.\nfrom collections import OrderedDict d = OrderedDict() d[\u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;c\u0026#39; d[\u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;java\u0026#39; d[\u0026#39;baz\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39; print(dict(d)) # prints {\u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;java\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;baz\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39;} Note: Since Python 3.7, regular dicts have guaranteed ordering. More here. Note however that they don\u0026rsquo;t completely replace OrderedDicts, since they have extra features:\nfrom collections import OrderedDict a = {1: 1, 2: 2} b = {2: 2, 1: 1} c = OrderedDict(a) d = OrderedDict(b) print(a == b) # returns True print(c == d) # returns False since OrderedDicts are order-sensitive, and regular dicts are not Also, OrderedDicts have methods to change order of elements, while regular dicts don\u0026rsquo;t.\nUsing deque instead of a list when updating Deques (double ended queues) are really fast in python3. They are implemented using doubly-linked lists, so inserting and removing at the end or at the beginning is O(1) complexity. Lists are implemented as normal arrays, so they have to sometimes realloc() to accomodate for the number of elements (only sometimes because by default it realloc()s more memory at the time than necessary\u0026rsquo;), so that makes them have O(n) complexity when inserting or removing at the beginning because they have to copy the rest of the elements.\nGenerally, updating a sequence is MUCH faster when using a deque() as opposed to using a list() (though keep in mind that accessing a random element in a deque() is expensive, whereas accessing a random element in a list() is O(1)).\nfrom collections import deque # Wrong! langs = [\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;python\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;java\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c++\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;kotlin\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39;] del langs[0] langs.pop(0) langs.insert(0, \u0026#39;scala\u0026#39;) # Right! langs = deque([\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;python\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;java\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c++\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;kotlin\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rust\u0026#39;]) del langs[0] langs.popleft(0) langs.appendleft(0, \u0026#39;scala\u0026#39;) Temporary contexts Usually there is the case that code like this is written in other languages:\nfrom decimal import getcontext, setcontext old_context = getcontext().copy() getcontext().prec = 50 print(Decimal(355) / Decimal(113)) setcontext(old_context) This can easily be replaced with contexts:\nfrom decimal import localcontext, Context with localcontext(Context(prec=50)): print(Decimal(355) / Decimal(113)) Other examples:\nWriting or reading from file f = open(\u0026#39;data.txt\u0026#39;) try: data = f.read() # do something with data finally: f.close() can be replaced with:\nwith open(\u0026#39;data.txt\u0026#39;) as f: data = f.read() # do something with data Deleting a file (getting rid of the try-except-pass idiom): try: os.remove(\u0026#39;sometempfile.tmp\u0026#39;) except OSError: pass can be replaced with:\nfrom contextlib import suppress with suppress(FileNotFoundError): os.remove(\u0026#39;sometempfile.tmp\u0026#39;) Note: suppress() is a reentrant context manager.

So use the lru_cache() decorator:\nfrom functools import lru_cache @lru_cache def web_lookup(url): return urllib.urlopen(url).read() More can be found here.\nTest a sequence or generator for truthness Using the any() function, you can check if at least one value in the iterable is True. It applies the bool() function to every element.\nfalse_lst = [0, False, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, 0.0, [], {}, None] # all of these return False when using bool() on them print(any(false_lst)) # prints False true_lst = [1, True, \u0026#39;x\u0026#39;, 3.14, [\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;], {\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;}] # all of these return True when using bool() on them print(any(true_lst)) # prints True falst_lst.append(-1) # any integer different from 0 is considered True print(any(false_lst)) # prints True Note: This function shortcircuits, meaning the first time it finds True it returns; it does NOT check for the rest of the values to be True.\nNote 2: It is really useful with generators:\nprint(any(range(1000000)) # prints True after 2 values evaluated, as range() is a generator print(any([range(1000000)])) # prints True after the whole list of 1000000 elements has been initialized, as range() has to populate the list first There is another function, all(), that does what it says: it tests for all the elements in the sequence to be True, and works much in the same way as any().\nUse namedtuples instead of tuples Aside from the fact that namedtuple()s are more verbose, they also offer better usage, as they can be treated as regular tuples, classes or even dictionaries.\nFor example, having a point:\npt1 = (2, 3) print(pt1[0], pt1[1]) # prints 2 3 can be replaced with the better alternative namedtuple():\nfrom collections import namedtuple Point = namedtuple(\u0026#39;Point\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;x y\u0026#39;) # a tuple named \u0026#39;Point\u0026#39; with attributes \u0026#39;x\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;y\u0026#39; # alternatively this means the exact same thing # Point = namedtuple(\u0026#39;Point\u0026#39;, [\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;]) pt1 = Point(2, 3) print(pt1) # prints Point(x=2, y=3) print(pt1.x, pt1.y) # prints 2 3 print(pt1[0], pt1[1]) # prints 2 3 print(dict(pt1._asdict())) # prints {\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;: 2, \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;: 3} print(pt1._replace(x=50)) # prints Point(x=50, y=3) # Note however that _replace() returns a modified copy. The original is still a tuple, so it cannot be modified Another common example:\nfrom collections import namedtuple Person = namedtuple(\u0026#39;Person\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;age color lang\u0026#39;) person = Person(31, \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;) print(person) # prints Person(age=31, color=\u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, lang=\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;) Note: When the values from a namedtuple() are invalid (e.g. having one of the fields named class or having the same field twice), it throws a ValueError. To avoid this you can possibly provide a third parameter named rename. If set to True, it will rename the field that is incorrect.\nfrom collections import namedtuple Person = namedtuple(\u0026#39;Person\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;age color age\u0026#39;, rename=True) print(Person(31, \u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;whatever\u0026#39;)) # prints Person(age=31, color=\u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, _2=\u0026#39;whatever\u0026#39;) Note 2: Since Python 3.8, _asdict() method returns a regular dictionary, as regular dicts now have guaranteed ordering based on insertion (since Python 3.7).\nProfiling code with cProfile Since Python 3.8, cProfile can be used as a context manager, making it extremely easy to profile code.\nimport cProfile with cProfile.Profile() as profiler: # code to be profiled profiler.print_stats() Pretty print stuff One way to format the output is to use the pprint module.\nfrom pprint import pprint d = { \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;: [*range(5)], \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;: [] \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;: \u0026#34;Here is a long string\u0026#34;.split(\u0026#34; \u0026#34;), } pprint(d, indent=2, width=20, compact=True) # prints # { \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;: [ \u0026#39;Here\u0026#39;, # \u0026#39;is\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, # \u0026#39;long\u0026#39;, # \u0026#39;string\u0026#39;], # \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, # 4], # \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;: []} Note: Since Python 3.8, the parameter sort_dicts was added (True by default):\nfrom pprint import pprint d = { \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;: [*range(5)], \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;: [] \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;: \u0026#34;Here is a long string\u0026#34;.split(\u0026#34; \u0026#34;), } pprint(d, indent=2, width=20, compact=True, sort_dicts=False) # prints # { \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, # 4], # \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;: [], # \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;: [ \u0026#39;Here\u0026#39;, # \u0026#39;is\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, # \u0026#39;long\u0026#39;, # \u0026#39;string\u0026#39;]} More info here.\nThe \u0026ldquo;is\u0026rdquo; operator vs \u0026ldquo;==\u0026rdquo; operator The is operator checks if 2 objects point to the same memory address.

One is the shallow copy, that works very similar to how assigning to pointers works in C (they only reference the object they point to, changing one also changes the other), and the other is the deep copy, which makes a perfect copy of the object.\nimport copy list1 = [1, 2, [3, 4], 5] list2 = copy.copy(list1) list2[2][1] = 6 list2[0] = 7 # shallow copy, list2 holds references to objects in list1, changing one also changes the other print(list1) # prints [1, 2, [3, 6], 5] print(list2) # prints [7, 2, [3, 6], 5] list3 = copy.deepcopy(list1) list3[2][1] = 8 list3[0] = 9 # deep copy, list3 is a perfect copy of list1 with no references to it, changing one doesn\u0026#39;t change the other print(list1) # prints [1, 2, [3, 6], 5] print(list3) # prints [9, 2, [3, 8], 5] More about deep and shallow copies here.\nPython\u0026rsquo;s built-in http server Python has a built-in http server; it can be super useful if you want to preview a website without going the hurdle of starting an apache or nginx server.\nThis serves the website in the current directory at address localhost:8000:\npython3 -m http.server Type annotations Python 3.5 supports type annotations, which can ensure better readability. Note however that they are only there for the programmer to acknowledge, Python does not care and won\u0026rsquo;t change anything based on them.\ndef func(s1: int, s2: int = 42) -\u0026gt; int: return s1 + s2 They can be changed to anything you want:\ndef func2(page: \u0026#39;web page\u0026#39;, request: \u0026#39;web request\u0026#39;) -\u0026gt; \u0026#39;web response\u0026#39;: # return response Note: Passing 2 strings to func() is perfectly valid, as Python does NOT care at all about these annotations (in this case the function would return the 2 strings concatenated).\nNote 2: You can use stuff like Mypy to enforce this kind of behaviour, so Python becomes statically-typed!\nMore info about type annotations can be found in PEP 484.\nNote 3: Since Python 3.6, PEP 526, more support for type annotations was added. Again, Python will always be a dynamically-typed language, but tools can be used to ensure static typing.\nCounter for iterables This is an easy method to find the most common elements in an iterable:\nimport collections count = collections.Counter(\u0026#39;some random string\u0026#39;) print(c.most_common()) # prints [(\u0026#39;s\u0026#39;, 2), (\u0026#39;o\u0026#39;, 2), (\u0026#39;m\u0026#39;, 2), (\u0026#39; \u0026#39;, 2), (\u0026#39;r\u0026#39;, 2), (\u0026#39;n\u0026#39;, 2), (\u0026#39;e\u0026#39;, 1), (\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, 1), (\u0026#39;d\u0026#39;, 1), (\u0026#39;t\u0026#39;, 1), (\u0026#39;i\u0026#39;, 1), (\u0026#39;g\u0026#39;, 1)] print(c.most_common(3)) # prints [(\u0026#39;s\u0026#39;, 2), (\u0026#39;o\u0026#39;, 2), (\u0026#39;m\u0026#39;, 2)] More info can be found in the Python docs for the Counter class.\nPermutations of an iterable Get permutations of an iterable:\nimport itertools lst = list(itertools.permutations(\u0026#39;abc\u0026#39;, 2)) print(lst) # prints [(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;), (\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;), (\u0026#39;b\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;), (\u0026#39;b\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;c\u0026#39;), (\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;), (\u0026#39;c\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;b\u0026#39;)] The function takes an iterable and another optional argument specifying the length of one permutation.\nGetting the representation of an object as a string Python has 2 methods to transform an object into a string (similar to other languages toString() methods); those are str() and repr().\nimport datetime now = datetime.date.today() print(str(now)) # prints \u0026#39;2020-02-12\u0026#39; print(repr(now)) # prints \u0026#39;datetime.date(2020, 2, 12)\u0026#39; The function str() is made for clarity, while the function repr() is made to be unambiguos about what the object represents.\nThe python console uses repr().\nPython disassembler Python has a built-in disassembler. It is very rudimentary, but it can help debug some code.\nimport dis def func(text): return \u0026#39;This is some text \\\u0026#39;\u0026#39; + str(text) + \u0026#39;\\\u0026#39;.\u0026#39; dis.dis(func) # 4 0 LOAD_CONST 1 (\u0026#34;This is some text \u0026#39;\u0026#34;) # 2 LOAD_GLOBAL 0 (str) # 4 LOAD_FAST 0 (text) # 6 CALL_FUNCTION 1 # 8 BINARY_ADD # 10 LOAD_CONST 2 (\u0026#34;\u0026#39;.\u0026#34;) # 12 BINARY_ADD # 14 RETURN_VALUE More info in the docs.\nLambda functions Lambda functions, as in other functional programming languages, are anonymous functions that don\u0026rsquo;t have a name. They are useful for small code that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require more than a line or two, and they are generally passed as arguments to other functions.\nOne such example that applies to all functional programming languages is the map() function. It takes a callable as the first argument (read function, lambda function, something that can be called), and an iterable as the second argument, and applies the function to each of the elements of the iterable, returning a new iterable.\nobj = map(lambda string: string.lower(), [\u0026#39;StRiNg\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ANOTHER string\u0026#39;]) print(list(obj)) # prints [\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;] This code does the exact same thing:\ndef stringlower(string): return string.lower() lst = [\u0026#39;StRiNg\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ANOTHER string\u0026#39;] obj = [] for item in lst: obj.append(stringlower(item)) print(obj) # prints [\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;] Another example:\npower_func = lambda x, y: x ** y print(power_func(2, 3)) # prints 8 x = (lambda a, b: a - b)(5, 4) print(x) # prints 1 Ip addresses in Python Python has an interesting module to work with Ip addresses:\nimport ipaddress address = ipaddress.ip_address(\u0026#39;192.168.100.14\u0026#39;) print(repr(address)) # prints IPv4Address(\u0026#39;192.168.100.14\u0026#39;) # you can even have arithmetic operations done on this address print(address + 3) # prints 192.168.100.17 More info here.\nSubclasses and subinstances In Python, you can check if a class is a subclass of some other class:\nclass BaseClass(): pass class SubClass(BaseClass): pass print(issubclass(SubClass, BaseClass)) # prints True print(issubclass(SubClass, object)) # prints True You can also check if some instance is an instance of the specified class or another sublass of that class:\nclass BaseClass(): pass class SubClass(BaseClass): pass obj = SubClass() print(isinstance(obj, BaseClass)) # prints True Asterisk (*) and slash (\\) in function definition (positional- and keyword-only function parameters) In Python 3, you can add an asterisk and a slash to a function definition with special meaning. Asterisk marks keyword-only parameters (that means parameters that can be given to the function just by keyword, not by position), while slash marks positional-only parameters (meaning parameters cannot be given by keyword, but by position only).\ndef func(positional_only_argument, /, positional_and_keyword_argument, *, keyword_only_argument): return positional_only_argument + positional_and_keyword_argument + keyword_only_argument print(func(1, 2, 3)) # Type error, third parameter should be keyword print(func(positional_only_argument = 1, 2, 3)) # Type error, first parameter is positional only print(func(1, 2, keyword_only_argument = 3)) # fine, prints 6 print(func(1, positional_and_keyword_argument = 2, keyword_only_argument = 3)) # fine, prints 6 Info and rationale about these 2 types of parameters can be found in PEP 3102 - keyword-only parameters and in PEP 570 - positional-only parameters.\nNote: Until Python 3.8, positional-only arguments could only be used in library functions. Starting from Python 3.8, they can be used in programmer constructions too.\nPython interactive shell Say you wrote some Python code like this:\ndef min(a, b): return a if a \u0026lt; b else b You can launch it in an interactive shell with python -i main.py, which is similar to calling only python in the command line, with the key difference that the python shell contains your function in the global scope as well. Go ahead, try it!\nPython debugger Python has a debugger, similar to gdb. One way to use it is to simply add import pdb; pdb.set_trace() in your program wherever u want the debugger to stop program execution.\nIn Python 3.7, the debugger can also be called on a script like this: python -m pdb script.py, and it stops when the module loads, just before executing the first line of the script.\ndef add(a, b): return a + b import pdb pdb.set_trace() # code execution will stop here, and the program will enter the debugger print(add(1, 2)) For more information on how to operate the python debugger, visit this.\nNote: Since Python 3.7, instead of import pdb; pdb.set_trace(), you can simply add a breakpoint() function call whenever you want the program to stop execution.\nThe walrus operator (:=) Python 3.8 introduced assignment expressions through the use of a new operator, called the walrus operator (if you look sideways, the operator looks like a walrus).\nAssignment expressions allow you to assign and return a value in the same expression, similar to how things work in a language like C.\nwhile (x := int(input(\u0026#34;What is your age?\u0026#34;))) \u0026gt; 18: print(\u0026#34;You are a grown-up!\u0026#34;) else: print(\u0026#34;You are a kid!\u0026#34;) It can be useful, for example in list comprehensions:\nlst = [y for x in \u0026#39;abcd\u0026#39; if (y := f(x)) is not None] # instead of having to compute f(x) twice lst = [f(x) for x in \u0026#39;abcd\u0026#39; if f(x) is not None] Arguably, the operator is a little confusing, and most of the times not needed and can be replaced with more expressive syntax. There are good arguments to why this operator is not needed in Python here.\nNonetheless, Python 3.8 adopted assignment expressions through the use of the walrus operator :=.\nFor more info on the walrus operator and assignment expressions, see PEP 572.\nFormatted strings (f-strings) Formatted string literals (or f-strings) are a construct added in Python 3.6 and have since become very popular due to the speed (see tip 7) and simplicity.\nSome examples:\nnumber = 3.1415 width = 10 precision = 3 print(f\u0026#39;This is {number:{width}.{precision}}\u0026#39;) # prints # This is 3.14 There are three conversion fields; r, s and a. What they do is call the functions repr(), str() and ascii() respectively on the formatted parameter.\nname = \u0026#39;Alex\u0026#39; print(f\u0026#39;My name is {name!r}\u0026#39;) # prints # My name is \u0026#39;Alex\u0026#39; Since Python 3.8, there is a new specifier (=), that expands to the representation of the expression, making it useful for debugging and self-documenting.\nimport datetime name = \u0026#39;Alex\u0026#39; print(f\u0026#39;{name=}\u0026#39;) # prints name=\u0026#39;Alex\u0026#39; now = datetime.date.today() print(f\u0026#39;{now=}\u0026#39;) # prints now=datetime.date(2020, 2, 14) # f-string specifiers still work print(f\u0026#39;{now=!s}\u0026#39;) # prints now=2020-02-14 number = 3.1415 # Careful when adding format specifiers print(f\u0026#39;{number + 1=:10.2f}\u0026#39;) # prints number + 1= 4.14 print(f\u0026#39;{number + 1=:10.2}\u0026#39;) # prints number + 1= 4.1 More info about f-strings in the docs.\nNote: Formatted strings have a \u0026lsquo;formatting\u0026rsquo; option similar to how printf() works in other languages. Python\u0026rsquo;s implementation of formatted print is a little more advanced though.\nDecorators and the functools.wraps helper function Say you have a function:\ndef sum(a, b): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;This function adds 2 numbers and returns the result.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; return a + b But now we want to log this function call. Of course, adding this code in the implementation of the function is bad, since we\u0026rsquo;re polluting the function code. Even more so, what if we want to log another 10 function calls?\nFor this purpose, we can easily use a decorator.\ndef log(func): def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Wrapper function.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # do some logging return func(*args, **kwargs) return wrapper Now it is easy to use the decorator on whatever function we want to log.\n@log def sum(a, b): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;This function adds 2 numbers and returns the result.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; return a + b print(sum(4, 5)) # this function call will be logged However, one problem arises when decorating a function like this. If we now try to get the doc or the function name, we notice that we get the information of the wrapper function, rather than that of our initial function:\nprint(sum.__doc__) # prints \u0026#34;Wrapper function\u0026#34; print(sum.__name__) # prints \u0026#34;wrapper\u0026#34; This is not ideal, considering that debuggers and other introspection tools use this. To fix this, we can use functools.wraps.\nimport functools def log(func): @functools.wraps(func) def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Wrapper function.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # do some logging return func(*args, **kwargs) return wrapper @log def sum(a, b): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;This function adds 2 numbers and returns the result.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; return a + b print(sum.__doc__) # prints \u0026#34;This function adds 2 numbers and returns the result.\u0026#34; print(sum.__name__) # prints \u0026#34;sum\u0026#34; Static function variables Python does not have a built-in method to have a static variable in a function like C or other languages do through the use of the static keyword.\nInstead, we can use the fact that functions are first-class objects in Python and we can assign variables to them.\ndef func(): try: func.number_of_times_called += 1 except: func.number_of_times_called = 1 # some really interesting code This is better than having a global variable pollute the global namespace, and is better than having a decorator that does that (because the decorator runs when the python module is loaded even if the function might never be called, so the decorator will still do some work and initialize some value; instead here the code runs only when the function is called, if ever).\n","permalink":"https://shenlong616.github.io/posts/github/python-3-tricks-by-alexghergh/","summary":"Disclaimer: This list is meant as a comprehension of cool tips and tricks I found on the internet.
